# Software Engineering Fundamentals in Python

## About

We are working on Software Engineering Fundamentals in Python by using the implementations as reference and applied theory such as: 

- [ ] Algorithms

- [ ] Data Structures

- [x] OOP Concepts

- [ ] Important Design Patterns in Python


Furthermore, all of the material contained herein (code, exercises and notes) are from different resources, like:

- Data Structures and Algorithms in Python (by Michael T. Goodrich)

- Dive into Design Patterns (by Alexander Shvets)

- Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS - The MIT Press)


By the way, note that till the end of our journey these contents and resources may change :)
