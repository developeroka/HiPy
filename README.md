## About

we are working on sofware engineering fundamentals in python by using the implementations as reference and applied theory such as: 

Algorithms
Data Structures
OOP Concepts
Important design patterns in python


in addition, code, exercises and notes are from differente recourses like:

Data structures and algorithms in python (by goodrich)
Dive into Design Patterns ()
CLRS (MIT university)


By the way, till the end of our journey these contents and resources may change :)
